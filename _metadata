Custom weapons are already added.\n\n\nToken are large humanoids, typically reaching six feet in height with some classes being taller than others. Within their society there were once seven sub-classes: Architects, Artisans, Techno-Mages, Berserkers, Pathfinders, Merchants, and Miners. Each class was defined genetically-- but not at birth. Token hatched from eggs, despite being mammals, and as the children matured they would gradually shed the layer of fine feathers that covered their bodies. However, unlike humans and other species, the Token didn't naturally undergo puberty; they were injected with the DNA of a matured \"donor\", allowing them to physically mature over the course of a week. As such, molters could choose the class they went into. At the end of the lifespan of their race, the Berserkers were in power.\n\nAs a Token ages, his or her power builds and multiplies in the form of \"Biochains\". Biochains have multiple uses outside of their bodies, and thus can be externalized. They were primarily externalized in the form of wings and halos, and often used in their technology and weapons.\n\nToken appear to be large, pale-skinned humans with three fingers and a thumb on each hand; their feet are also more like hands, having a very similar structure to a monkey's. Their long tails are prehensile and often have a \"mind\" of their own. Their bodies are covered in various areas of scales or \"muscle texture\", which highlight primary groups of muscles on them; they are far more prominent on the males than on the females, and even more on Berserkers than on any other class. Oftentimes their tails are covered in feathers. The males grow thick, wiry beards that are actually nerves grown out from their bodies; the hair on the scalp of a female's head is made of the same substance. As such, the females can't cut their hair, and the males can't shave; however, since the males' head-hair was not made of the wiry nerves, they could cut it as they wished. Any hair that isn't actually the nerve-growth (the feathers on their tails, for example, and the \"hair\" that grows on the heads of the males) is instead very fine feathers. Token also don't have eyebrows, and their noses are much flatter than a human's.\n\nTheir tech was highly advanced, allowing them to cross galaxies in an instant long before humans could even think of the stars as a place. But for a long time before their downfall, their development fell into a state of stagnation; they had simply burned out all of their resources, intelligence, and potential for advancement.\n\nDesignwise, their stuff is a sort of mix between Halo, Tron, and various \"mystical\" sources of inspiration.",
